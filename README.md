Use the files in this repository to start your assignment.

Execute the following once ( **replacing** the url and directory names ):

	$ cd my_DSLab_folder/
	$ git clone https://git-classes.mst.edu/ _url-for-your-repository_
	$ cd _my_cloned_repo_lab0n/_

Complete the post-lab by creating and editing the following files in your repository folder:
* Source files like `.cpp, .h, .hpp`
* Code::Blocks project folder with `.cbp` and `.layout` files


Do not add:
* Compiled or generated files like `a.out`, your executable files, etc.
* Put the name of these files in a text file named `.gitignore`

Execute as many times as you want:

	$ git status

	$ git diff

	$ git add *.cpp *.h *.hpp *.txt *.cbp

	$ git add yourfile.whatever

	$ git add SUBDIRECTORY/*

	$ git commit -m "Informative description of the commit"

	$ git push

If you see your changes reflected on the git-classes site, you have submitted successfully.
