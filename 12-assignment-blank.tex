\title{Lab 12: \LaTeX}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section*{Directions}
Your lab assignment today is to write the code to produce \textbf{this document (yes this one, the whole thing)} as well as a ''README.md'' which mimics this. you should end up with a second copy of this document at the end, but one that you compiled using \LaTeX\ via the \texttt{pdflatex}command.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item First, write some ''code''(hint: \LaTeX\ is popular on stack overflow).
	\item Then, compile it with \texttt{pdflatex}.
	\item Check the pdf to see if it looks right.
	\item Rinse, repeat.
	\item When you're done, submit your text file and ''README.md''.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Text Formatting}
Sometimes, you may want to \underline{\textbf{emphasize}} some text.

\subsection*{Problem 0: Latent Dirichlet Allocation}
Hey, can you help me with my homework? In Laten Dirichlet Allocation, we might need to use the equation for callapsed Gibbs sampling with equal document lengths $N$. (hint: math symbols can't be emphasized like text)

According to our model, the total probability is given as follows:
\begin{equation}
	P(W , Z, \theta, \phi, \alpha, \beta) = \prod_{i=1}^{K} P (\phi_i: \beta) \prod_{j=1}^{M} P (\theta_j ; \alpha) \prod_{t=1}^{N} p (Z_{j,t}|\theta_j )P (W_{j,t}|\phi_{Z_{j,t}} )
\end{equation}

After some fancy math on (1), integrating $\phi$ and $\theta$ out gives us
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	P (Z, W ; \alpha, \beta) = \prod_{j=1}^{M} \frac{\Gamma(\sum_{i=1}^{K} \alpha_i) \prod_{i=1}^{K} \Gamma(n_{j,(.)}^i + \alpha_i)}
	{ \prod_{i=1}^{K} \Gamma(\alpha_i) \Gamma(\sum_{i=1}^{K} n_{j,(.)}^i + \alpha_i)}
	&\quad \times \prod_{j=1}^{K} \frac{ \Gamma(\sum_{r=1}^{V} \beta_r) \prod_{r=1}^{V} \Gamma(n_{(.),r}^i + \beta_r)}
	{ \prod_{r=1}^{V} \Gamma(\beta_r) \Gamma(\sum_{r=1}^{V} n_{(.),r}^i +\beta_r)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Now we can work with that!

\subsection*{Problem 1: Let's Learn Markdown!}
Make your git page's README.md to mimic tghis paper. HINT: you can embed latex equations into your markdown. you oculd use Pandoc, but don't becuase that's cheating. To keep it simple, I'd recommend turning your equations into images.
